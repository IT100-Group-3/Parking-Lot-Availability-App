 

Design – Costco Parking Digital Sign 

  

We wanted to create a sign that would be eco-friendly so we came up with the idea to make it run on a solar panel. Initially it would be expensive but in the long run it’ll be worth it as people are able to benefit from it. 

  

The design would be simple such as a green car that represents an open parking space while a red car would represent an occupied space. For each section there will be a solar panel bank that would generate power throughout the day. Once the store is closed the power bank will have a timed off mechanism to conserve the remaining energy.
